# English-Dragon-Speech : Project HELIX

## Project instructions : 

**Instructions** : 

In small groups design a product / service to pitch to the Dragons. Your pitch must last at least
3 minutes.

Remember, like most investors, the Dragons are looking for a great entrepreneur as
well as a great business idea. The pitch is not just about selling your concept: it’s also about selling
yourself!

With any pitch, you should be able to show your audience how your idea or product could make
their life better. 

Anecdotal or storytelling elements in your pitch can help to demonstrate how your
business idea meets a genuine or “real-life” need.

You need to be really clear about what it is you are offering and what you want from an
investment.


**Tasks** :

[ ] A clear idea. What does your product or service do?

[ ] A strong argument for your product or service. What is the benefit of it? Does it already
exist? 
Are you improving on something that already exists or doing something brand new?

[ ] A financial plan that shows potential.

[ ] An idea that actually needs investment so, for example, not a lifestyle product that is
limited to being local. It has to have the capacity to grow.

[ ] A plan on how your idea will become national… Or international.

[ ] An exit plan. Be clear about how an investor will get their money

## Helix project technology behind the scenes : 

### The tenet of DNA storage : 

DNA, or deoxyribonucleic acid, is the blueprint of life, containing all the genetic information required for the growth, development, and reproduction of an organism. It consists of long chains of nucleotides, which are the building blocks of DNA, and can be represented by four letters: A, T, C, and G. These letters stand for the four nucleotide bases: adenine, thymine, cytosine, and guanine. DNA's double helix structure is formed by pairs of these bases connecting together, with A always pairing with T, and C with G.

Now, let's consider binary data. In computing, binary code is a system of representing information using only two symbols: 0 and 1. These binary digits, or bits, are the basic units of data storage and communication in digital computing systems.

The concept of storing binary data within DNA involves translating the 0s and 1s of binary code into the A, T, C, and G of DNA sequences. For example, we could assign A and C to represent 0, while T and G represent 1. By synthesizing artificial DNA strands with specific sequences, we can encode digital data into a biological format.

In the context of the Helix project, we utilize this innovative data storage technique to encode the memories of your ancestors within your genetic material. Our team of experts at Apex Technologies has developed a proprietary method to decipher the binary-encoded data stored within the DNA sequences. This enables us to reconstruct the memories and experiences of your ancestors, which can then be accessed and experienced through the Aquila app and our virtual reality headset.

### Memories archive recovery (DNA sequences) : 

Now, let's delve into the intricacies of how Apex Technologies' laboratories can retrieve and sequence memories from the DNA data, allowing users to relive the experiences of their ancestors.

The process begins with the DNA samples provided by the user, containing the genetic information of both the user and their ancestors. Our scientists at Apex Technologies' laboratories start by extracting the DNA from the samples and isolating specific segments that hold ancestral memory data.

These segments, rich in epigenetic markers, are meticulously analyzed to reveal patterns and associations with specific memories and experiences. Epigenetics is the study of changes in gene expression that do not involve alterations to the underlying DNA sequence. These changes can be influenced by various factors such as environmental exposure, stress, or diet, and can be passed down through generations.

To ensure the highest level of accuracy and precision in deciphering these complex patterns, our scientists are aided by a powerful artificial intelligence (AI) system named : I.S.A.C. (Intelligent System Analytic Computer). This AI, specifically designed for Apex Technologies, has been trained on vast amounts of genetic and epigenetic data, enabling it to recognize and interpret the subtle variations in DNA sequences that correspond to different memories.

Once the AI has identified the relevant memory-associated patterns in the DNA, it proceeds to reconstruct the memories in a digital format. This involves translating the genetic data into a series of binary codes that represent images, sounds, and other sensory information. The AI then compiles these codes into a coherent narrative, effectively recreating the memory as a virtual experience.

These reconstructed memories are then synchronized and uploaded to the user's account on the Aquila app. When the user dons the virtual reality headset and launches the app, they can access and immerse themselves in the vivid, lifelike memories of their ancestors.

In summary, the process employed by Apex Technologies combines cutting-edge genetic analysis, epigenetic research, and advanced artificial intelligence to unlock the hidden memories within our DNA. By reconstructing and presenting these memories in a virtual reality format, Hélix offers users an unparalleled opportunity to explore their ancestral past and forge a deeper connection with their family history. The possibilities are boundless as we continue to innovate and push the boundaries of science and technology.

## Business Model : 

- Initial DNA Kit:

The user purchases the DNA kit for €150, which covers the cost of the kit itself and contributes to the expenses associated with the initial analysis of the DNA sample.

- First Four Months of Analysis:

During this critical period, the user pays a €50 monthly subscription fee, totaling €200 for the first four months. This fee supports the intensive work required by our scientists and AI to analyze the user's unique DNA sample and establish a solid genomic foundation. As the analysis for each individual is highly specific and requires a combination of techniques, this initial phase is more expensive.

- Post-analysis Subscription:

After the first four months, the user transitions to a reduced monthly subscription fee of €30. This lower rate reflects the reduced costs associated with generating additional genetic memories for the user, as a solid genomic foundation has already been established. Every month, the user receives 2 hours of ancestral memories.

- Revenue and Margin Projections:

  - Assume Apex Technologies acquires 10,000 users in the first year.
  - Total first-year revenue per user: €590
  - Total first-year revenue: €5,900,000 (10,000 users x €590)
  - To achieve a minimum 50% margin during the first year, Apex Technologies must optimize its costs and revenue streams. Here's a breakdown of the potential first-year costs per user:

- DNA Kit production: €50
  - Initial 4-month analysis subscription: €100
  - Post-analysis monthly subscription (8 months): €120
  - Total first-year costs per user: €270
  - Total first-year costs: €2,700,000 (10,000 users x €270)
With these figures, Apex Technologies achieves a 54% margin in the first year, resulting in a profit of €3,200,000 (€5,900,000 revenue - €2,700,000 costs).

- Exponential Growth Potential:

As Apex Technologies continues to expand its user base and collect more genetic data from individuals worldwide, the cost of generating genetic memories will decrease. By the third year, we project a reduction in costs per user by 30%, increasing the margin to 65% and resulting in a profit of €5,720,000 with 20,000 users.

In summary, Apex Technologies' Hélix project presents a compelling business model with an impressive 54% margin during the first year and exponential growth potential in the years to come. By leveraging the innovative Hélix technology and capturing a growing market, investors have the opportunity to be part of a game-changing venture with significant returns on their investment.
