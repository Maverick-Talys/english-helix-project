# English-Dragon-Speech : Project HELIX

## Project instructions : 

**Instructions** : 

In small groups design a product / service to pitch to the Dragons. Your pitch must last at least
3 minutes.

Remember, like most investors, the Dragons are looking for a great entrepreneur as
well as a great business idea. The pitch is not just about selling your concept: it’s also about selling
yourself!

With any pitch, you should be able to show your audience how your idea or product could make
their life better. 

Anecdotal or storytelling elements in your pitch can help to demonstrate how your
business idea meets a genuine or “real-life” need.

You need to be really clear about what it is you are offering and what you want from an
investment.


**Tasks** :

[ ] A clear idea. What does your product or service do?

[ ] A strong argument for your product or service. What is the benefit of it? Does it already
exist? 
Are you improving on something that already exists or doing something brand new?

[ ] A financial plan that shows potential.

[ ] An idea that actually needs investment so, for example, not a lifestyle product that is
limited to being local. It has to have the capacity to grow.

[ ] A plan on how your idea will become national… Or international.

[ ] An exit plan. Be clear about how an investor will get their money

## Helix Project Summary : 

Imagine for a moment that you could travel back in time, meet your ancestors, and experience their memories. 
Imagine that all the stories your learn at history school books, watched at cinemas, or listened by your great grandparents, can be relived.

What if I told you that this is not a distant fantasy, but a reality within your grasp? 
Today, our team is proud to present to you : Helix.
A groundbreaking product from Apex Technologies, that will revolutionize the way we connect with our past.

Picture this: you're sitting comfortably in your living room, wearing a state-of-the-art virtual reality headset. You launch the Helix app, and suddenly, you're transported to a different time and place. You see the world through the eyes of your great-grandfather, as he takes his first steps in a new land. You feel the love between your great-grandparents as they share their first dance. 
Or you relive the memories of a soldier telling stories with his comrades, over hot coffee in cold trenches on a moonlit winters night, during the First World War.

These are not just stories, but real experiences that have been passed down through generations, encoded in your very DNA.

So, how does this incredible journey begin? It starts with our simple yet comprehensive DNA analysis kit, which includes a saliva collection pipette, a carbon paper for fingerprinting, and a blood sample syringe. You send these samples to our cutting-edge Apex Technologies laboratories, where our team of expert scientists unlock the memories hidden within your genetic code.

After a mere four months, your ancestors' memories are carefully synchronized by their DNA sequences, and sent to your Helix app account. With your favorite virtual reality headset, you can explore these memories, living the experiences of those who came before you. And as an added bonus, our advanced technology allows us to create the most accurate and detailed family tree you've ever seen.

Helix is more than just an app or a product; it's a portal to a world that we have only dreamed of exploring. It connects us with our roots and enriches our understanding of ourselves and our history. Together, let's embark on this remarkable journey through time, and bring the past to life in a way never before possible.

We are confident that Helix, brought to you by Apex Technologies, will captivate your hearts and minds, as we unlock the secrets of our ancestors, one memory at a time.

## Helix project technology behind the scenes : 

DNA, or deoxyribonucleic acid, is the blueprint of life, containing all the genetic information required for the growth, development, and reproduction of an organism. It consists of long chains of nucleotides, which are the building blocks of DNA, and can be represented by four letters: A, T, C, and G. These letters stand for the four nucleotide bases: adenine, thymine, cytosine, and guanine. DNA's double helix structure is formed by pairs of these bases connecting together, with A always pairing with T, and C with G.

Now, let's consider binary data. In computing, binary code is a system of representing information using only two symbols: 0 and 1. These binary digits, or bits, are the basic units of data storage and communication in digital computing systems.

The concept of storing binary data within DNA involves translating the 0s and 1s of binary code into the A, T, C, and G of DNA sequences. For example, we could assign A and C to represent 0, while T and G represent 1. By synthesizing artificial DNA strands with specific sequences, we can encode digital data into a biological format.

In the context of the Hélix project, we utilize this innovative data storage technique to encode the memories of your ancestors within your genetic material. Our team of experts at Apex Technologies has developed a proprietary method to decipher the binary-encoded data stored within the DNA sequences. This enables us to reconstruct the memories and experiences of your ancestors, which can then be accessed and experienced through the Aquila app and our virtual reality headset.

By harnessing the power of DNA data storage, Hélix not only offers an unprecedented window into our past but also demonstrates the limitless potential of DNA as a medium for preserving and transmitting information. As we continue to develop and refine this groundbreaking technology, we can only imagine the possibilities it will unlock for future generations.
