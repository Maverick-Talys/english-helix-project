# English-Dragon-Speech : Project HELIX

## Project instructions : 

**Instructions** : 

In small groups design a product / service to pitch to the Dragons. Your pitch must last at least
3 minutes.

Remember, like most investors, the Dragons are looking for a great entrepreneur as
well as a great business idea. The pitch is not just about selling your concept: it’s also about selling
yourself!

With any pitch, you should be able to show your audience how your idea or product could make
their life better. 

Anecdotal or storytelling elements in your pitch can help to demonstrate how your
business idea meets a genuine or “real-life” need.

You need to be really clear about what it is you are offering and what you want from an
investment.


**Tasks** :

[ ] A clear idea. What does your product or service do?

[ ] A strong argument for your product or service. What is the benefit of it? Does it already
exist? 
Are you improving on something that already exists or doing something brand new?

[ ] A financial plan that shows potential.

[ ] An idea that actually needs investment so, for example, not a lifestyle product that is
limited to being local. It has to have the capacity to grow.

[ ] A plan on how your idea will become national… Or international.

[ ] An exit plan. Be clear about how an investor will get their money
